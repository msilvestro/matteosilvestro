            I'm a scatterbrained wanderer always looking for new routes. My life
            is an adagio sostenuto in A minor played on a strange instrument.

            I seek beauty in the tidy lines of a source code, in the harmonious
            flow of notes in a music staff and in the refined perfection of a
            mathematical formula.

            If you want to know me, you can discover the different sides of
            myself though the nav cube on the left.

            <p>
              In my free time I struggle to get bored, I have far too many
              hobbies, like enjoying a good story (whatever the medium) or
              building hopefully useful software.

            <p>
              I studied mathematics because I always loved its problem-solving
              challenge and elegance in the solutions. I then fell in love with
              probability and statistics.

            <h3>Work</h3>
            <p>
              I'm a developer with a mathematical background. I like to tackle a
              problem in an abstract manner and then implement it in code.
