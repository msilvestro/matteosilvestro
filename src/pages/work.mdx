## Work

I'm a developer with a mathematical background. I also dabble in the art of
musical arrangements.

Check out [my resume](/matteo_silvestro_resume.pdf) to know more about my professional
experience.

### Code tools

I detest doing repetitive and menial work, so I always try to make tasks simpler
and more efficient using code.

You can find all of my works on [GitHub][gh]. Here is a selection of them:

- [this website][website], now written in Next.js;
- [My spot][my-spot], a React app I've written for me and my family to help
  manage screen sharing on Netflix;
- [HowLongToBeat Oracle][hltb], a library to browse HowLongToBeat entries;
- [Qlik Butler][qlik], a simple Powershell tool to manage Qlik and NPrinting
  clusters.

### Music

I love music and I like to write arrangements of songs that caught my attention.

In my [YouTube channel][yt] you can find some covers performed by me using quite
a few different and unusual instruments. It all started with the [National
Anthem of Italy on a Stylophone][anthem].

Lately I've been focusing on writing arrangements for piano which I then publish
on [MuseScore][ms]. Most of the times I improve on already existing scores, but
I made a few of them entirely by ear, such as the cover of [High Without Your
Love][hwyl].

### Videogames

To me videogames are the highest form of art, with their unique blend of
interactivity, animations and music.

You can find my games on [itch.io][itch]. I participated in a few game jams,
which are great opportunities to improve your game development skills and find
new teammates.
