## Work

I'm a developer with a mathematical background. I like to tackle problems in an
abstract manner and then implement solutions in code. I also dabble in the art
of musical arrangements.

Check out [my resume](/resume.pdf) to know more about my professional experience.

### Code tools

I detest doing repetitive and menial work, so I always try to make tasks
simpler and more efficient using code.

You can find all of my works on [GitHub][gh], here is a showcase of some of
them:

- [this website][website], now written in Next.js;
- [My spot][my-spot], a React app I've written for me and my family to help
  manage screen sharing on Netflix;
- [HowLongToBeat Oracle][hltb], a library to browse HowLongToBeatr entries;
- [Qlik Butler][qlik], a simple Powershell tool to manage Qlik and NPrinting
  clusters.

### Music

I love music and I like to write arrangements of songs that caught my ear.

In my [YouTube channel][yt] you can find some covers performed by me using quite
a few different and unusual instruments. It all started with the
[National Anthem of Italy on a Stylophone][anthem].

Lately I focused more on writing arrangements for piano (which is the main
instrument I play and love) which I then publish on [MuseScore][ms]. Most of the
times I improve on already existing scores, but I made a few of them entirely by
ear, such as the underappreciated [High Without Your Love][hwyl] cover.
