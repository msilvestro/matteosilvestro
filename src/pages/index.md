## Myself

> Good ideas don't take time. They take a lot of bad ideas first.

I'm a scatterbrained wanderer always looking for new routes. My life
is an adagio sostenuto in A minor played on a strange instrument.

I seek beauty in the tidy lines of a source code, in the harmonious
flow of notes in a music staff and in the refined perfection of a
mathematical formula.

If you want to know me, you can discover the different sides of
myself though the nav cube on the left.

### Fun

In my free time I struggle to get bored, I have far too many
hobbies, like enjoying a good story (whatever the medium) or
building hopefully useful software.

### Education

I studied mathematics because I always loved its problem-solving
challenge and elegance in the solutions. I then fell in love with
probability and statistics.

### Work

I'm a developer with a mathematical background. I like to tackle a
problem in an abstract manner and then implement it in code.
