## Education

I'm always eager to learn new things. My main interests are mathematics, app
and game programming, and music.

### University

I studied mathematics because I always loved its problem-solving challenges and
elegance in the solutions. I then fell in love with probability and statistics.

My bachelor's thesis, [MCTS e videogiochi: un'applicazione per le Gare Pokémon
Live][mcts], was an amusing and almost reckless adventure, but in the end the
results were very interesting and promising. Furthermore, I succeeded in
combining Pokémon with mathematics, and I'm quite proud of that.

My Master's Degree thesis, [Computer-Assisted Evaluation of Story-Driven
Interactive Storytelling Systems][dupin], was my latest effort in which I
managed to weave together storytelling and machine learning. I wanted to get as
closer as possible to the field of videogame studies and working on creating a
clustering of interactive stories through tension curves was quite a good topic
nonetheless.

I also implemented the [Coupling from the past][cftp] algorithm for image
restoration in R.
