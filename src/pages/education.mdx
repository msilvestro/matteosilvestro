## Education

I'm always eager to learn new things. My main interests are in mathematics, app
and game programming, and music.

### University

I studied mathematics because I always loved its problem-solving challenges and
elegance in the solutions. I then fell in love with probability and statistics.

My bachelor's thesis, [MCTS e videogiochi: un'applicazione per le Gare Pokémon
Live](https://github.com/msilvestro/mcts-contest), was an amusing and almost
reckless adventure, but in the end the results were very interesting and
promising. Furthermore, I succeeded in combining Pokémon with mathematics, and
I'm quite proud of that.

My Master's Degree thesis, [Computer-Assisted Evaluation of Story-Driven
Interactive Storytelling Systems](https://github.com/msilvestro/dupin), was my
latest effort in which I managed to weave together storytelling and machine
learning. I wanted to get as closer as possible to the field of videogame
studies and working on creating a clustering of interactive stories through
tension curves was quite a good topic nonetheless.

I also implemented the [Coupling from the past][cftp] algorithm for image
restoration in R.
