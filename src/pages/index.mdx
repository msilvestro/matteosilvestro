myself though the navigation cube.

[Fun](/fun). In my free time I never get bored since I have far too many
hobbies, like enjoying a good story (whatever the medium) or building hopefully
useful software.

[Education](/education). I studied mathematics because I always loved its
problem-solving challenges and elegance in the solutions. I then fell in love
with probability and statistics.

problems in an abstract manner and then implement solutions in code.
