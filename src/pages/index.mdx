## About me

> Good ideas don't take time.
> They take a lot of bad ideas first.

Mathematician by education, coder by passion, I play the piano and love
videogames.

### My sides

If you want to know more about me, you can discover the different sides of
me though the navigation cube.

[Fun](/fun). In my free time, when I'm not working on side projects or learning
something new, I dedicate myself to one of my many pastimes, such as enjoying a
good story (whatever the medium) or cooking.

[Education](/education). I'm always eager to learn new things. My main interests
are mathematics, app and game programming, and music.

[Work](/work). I'm a developer with a mathematical background. I like to tackle
problems in an abstract manner and then implement solutions in code. I also
dabble in the art of musical arrangements.

I also leave bits of me scattered though the web, so this profile would be
incomplete without my social sides.
