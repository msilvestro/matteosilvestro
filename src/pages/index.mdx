## About me

> Good ideas don't take time.
> They take a lot of bad ideas first.
> â€”Ral Zarek

Mathematician by education, coder by passion, I play the piano and love
videogames.

### My sides

If you want to know more about me, you can discover the different sides of
myself though the navigation cube.

[Fun](/fun). I never get bored since I have far too many hobbies, like enjoying a good story
(whatever the medium) or building hopefully useful software.

[Education](/education). I studied mathematics because I always loved its
problem-solving challenges and elegance in the solutions. I then fell in love
with probability and statistics.

[Work](/work). I'm a developer with a mathematical background. I like to tackle
problems in an abstract manner and then implement solutions in code.

I also leave bits of myself scattered though the web, so my profile would be
incomplete without my social sides.
