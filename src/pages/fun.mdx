## Fun

In my free time, when I'm not [working](/work) on side projects or
[learning](/education) something new, I dedicate myself to one of my many
pastimes, such as enjoying a good story (whatever the medium) or cooking.

### My recommendations

Play [Persona 5][p5]. An improbable role-playing game, a masterpiece of style
with a compelling story about timeless topics and the human heart. After you
finish it, don't forget to play its great sequel, [Persona 5 Strikers][p5s].

Play [NieR: Automata][automata]. An emotional tale set in a wonderful world.
It is an underrated masterpiece, full of tragic and beautiful moments. You'll
never be the same after you finish it.

Play [Sayonara Wild Hearts][sayonara]. A brief but beautiful adventure about
overcoming hard times. It is heartwarming, incredibly satisfying to play and
has just the perfect music.

Watch [The Good Place][the_good_place]. A TV series for everyone that, between
philosophical dilemmas and hilarious moments, makes you cry and laugh heartily.

Read [12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos][12_rules]. A collection of simple
but well-explained rules to live a better life, it is very provocative and
full of references.

Read or watch [Attack on Titan][aot]. Taking place in a post-apocalyptic dark
fantasy world, it is the most imaginative, crude and exciting story I have ever
read (or watched).
