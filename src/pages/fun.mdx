## Fun

I never get bored since I have far too many hobbies, like enjoying a good story
(whatever the medium) or building hopefully useful software.

### My recommendations

Play [Persona 5][persona_5]. An improbable role-playing game, a masterpiece of
style with a compelling story about timeless topics and the human nature. Don't
forget to play the great sequel Persona 5 Strikers.

Play [Danganronpa][danganronpa]. A series about a group of students caught in a
killing game. It is absolutely crazy and full of plot twists, a must-play for
every mistery thriller lover like me.

Play [Journey][journey]. A brief but touching journey shared with other
wanderers in the midst of breathtaking landscapes.

Watch [The Good Place][the_good_place]. A TV series for everyone that, between
philosophical dilemmas and hilarious moments, makes you cry and laugh heartily.

Read [12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos][12_rules]. A collection of simple
but well-explained rules to live a better life, very provocative and full
of reference to several studies.

Read or watch [Attack on Titan][aot]. Taking place in a post-apocalyptic dark
fantasy world, it is the most imaginative, crude and exciting story I've ever
read (or watched).
