I leave you to the wise words of Phoenix Wright:

> No one can change the past.
>
> The only thing we can do is strive to make up for our mistakes.
>
> Why must we make up for our mistakes, you ask?
>
> Because in so doing... we can find the way back to our rightful path.
>
> And it is from there that we can move on toward a brighter future.
