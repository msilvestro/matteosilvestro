## Introduction

I'm Matteo Silvestro, a scatterbrained wanderer always looking for new routes. This is my personal page, in which I express myself and showcase my works.

### My persona

> Good ideas don't take time. They take a lot of bad ideas first.  
> â€”Ral Zarek

I'm a scatterbrained wanderer always looking for new routes. My life is an adagio sostenuto in A minor played on a <abbr title="Stylophone, Otamatone, Theremin, anything goes.">strange instrument</abbr>.

I seek beauty in the tidy lines of a source code, in the harmonious flow of notes in a music staff and in the refined perfection of a mathematical formula.

My personae are scattered around the web, each with its own purpose.
On [Facebook][fb] you can find my most frivolous side, on [LinkedIn][li] the most professional one. On [Twitter][tw] there are short and refined telegrams, on [Instagram][ig] moments that caught my attention.
My volatile musical obsession are recorded on [Last.fm][lf], while [Steam][st] keeps tabs on the countless videogame experiences I dive in.
My musical projects find place on [YouTube][yt] and [MuseScore][ms], while [GitHub][gh] collects my coding works.

Finally, here are a few advices, absolutely nothing mandatory.

Watch [The Good Place][the_good_place]. A TV series for everyone that, between philosophical dilemmas and hilarious moments, makes you cry and laugh heartily.

Play [Journey][journey] and [Persona 5][persona_5]. The first videogames is a brief but touching journey together with other wanderers in the midst of breathtaking landscapes. The latter is an improbable role-playing game, a masterpiece of style with a compelling story about timeless topics.

Read [Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking][quiet]. A tell-tale book about the nature of introverts, whose strong points are often underestimated.
