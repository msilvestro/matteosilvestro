I'm a scatterbrained wanderer always looking for new routes. My life is an adagio sostenuto in A minor played on a strange instrument.
I seek beauty in the tidy lines of a source code, in the harmonious flow of notes in a music staff and in the refined perfection of a mathematical formula.
Mathematician by education, coder by passion, I play the piano and love videogames.
